## Topics
Today I completed the challenges:

Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
Adding another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.
Completed the Quiz
